NFL Stats Analyzer in Python that ingests real weekly player stats and team scores via nfl_data_py, engineers features (e.g., passer efficiency, yards-per-target, rush TD rate), and visualizes their relationship to outcomes like team points, point differential, and win rate. The tool runs correlation analyses, win-rate-by-quartile views, and a Random Forest feature-importance model to identify which player metrics most influence results, exporting charts and an impact report CSV.
